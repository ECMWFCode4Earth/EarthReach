Data extractors package.

Contains modules for extracting meteorological information from GRIB files,
including pressure data extractors that enhance prompt generation.

Data extractors are optional experimental components that can be created and
integrated with the system to improve the relevance and consistency of the
descriptions, but they are not mandatory to the system's core functionality.
