EarthReach is an accessibility-focused python library. It's goal is to enable blind and low-vision earth scientists to access information present in weather-charts.

This library is designed to extend the **earthkit-plots** library, by providing an optional easy to use integration point. It leverages the rich data and metadata contained in GRIB files and a framework of dual LLMs, a generator, and an evaluator, with access to the data and the image of the weather chart, to generate a scientific description.
